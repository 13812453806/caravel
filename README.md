* `WKWebView` support
* iOS ~> JavaScript supported types:
  - `Bool`
  - `Int`
  - `Float`
  - `Double`
  - `String`
  - Any array (using types in this list, including dictionaries)
  - Any dictionary (using types in this list, including arrays)
* JavaScript ~> iOS supported types:
  - `Boolean`
  - `Int`
  - `Float` (available as a `Double`)
  - `String`
  - `Array` (available as a `NSArray`)

## Installation

### Using CocoaPods

Add this line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Caravel'
```

And run `pod install`. Once installed, open the `Pods` folder. Navigate to `caravel/caravel/js`. In this folder, drag and drop `caravel.min.js` into your Xcode project. You should load this JS script in any webpage you use Caravel.

### Using Carthage

Add this line to your Cartfile:

```
github "coshx/caravel"
```

And run `carthage update`. Once installed, open the `Carthage/Checkouts` folder. Navigate to `caravel/caravel/js`. In this folder, drag and drop `caravel.min.js` into your Xcode project. You should load this JS script in any webpage you use Caravel.

### Using as a submodule

Clone this repo and add `Caravel.xcodeproj` into your workspace.

## Get started

Caravel allows developers to communicate between their `UIWebView` and the embedded JS. You can send any kind of message between those two folks.

Have a glance at this super simple sample. Let's start with the iOS part:

```swift
class MyController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var webView: UIWebView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Prepare your bus before loading your web view's content
        Caravel.getDefault(self, webView: webView, whenReady: { bus in
            // In this scope, the JS endpoint is ready to handle any event.
            // Register and post your events here
            bus.post("MyEvent", data: [1, 2, 3])
            
            self.bus = bus // You can save your bus for firing events later
        })
        
        // ... Load web view's content there
    }
}
```

And now, in your JS:

```javascript
Caravel.getDefault().register("AnEventWithAString", function(name, data) {
    alert('I received this string: ' + data);
});
```

And voil√†!

## WKWebView

Caravel 1.1.0 supports `WKWebView`. Keep in mind this class is still in beta and might not work as expected. We won't ship you a üçï if your app does not work. 

Anyway. If you're this kind of guy involved in some risky business, here how to use Caravel with this object. Be careful, it is a two-step process.

```swift
class MyController: UIViewController {
    private var wkWebView: WKWebView?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let config = WKWebViewConfiguration()
        // First generate a draft using your custom configuration
        let draft = Caravel.getDraft(config)

        // Build your WKWebView as usual then
        self.wkWebView = WKWebView(frame: self.view.bounds, configuration: config)

        // Then initiate Caravel
        Caravel.getDefault(self, wkWebView: self.wkWebView!, draft: draft, whenReady: {
            // Do whatever you've got to do here
        })

        // ... Load content into your WKWebView there
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### I want to use my custom UIWebViewDelegate. What should I do?

To raise iOS events, Caravel must be the delegate of the provided `UIWebView`. However, if there is any existing delegate, Caravel saves it before setting its own. So, if you would like to use your custom one, simply set it **before** any call to Caravel.

### I want to use my custom WKUserContentController. What should I do?

To raise iOS events, Caravel adds a custom `WKScriptMessageHandler` to the current content controller. If you would like to use your custom one, simply set it **before** any call to Caravel.

### What object should I use as a subscriber?

A subscriber could be any object **except the watched target** (either the `UIWebView` or the `WKWebView`). We recommend to use the controller as a subscriber (it is a common pattern).

### Reserved names

`CaravelInit` is an internal event, sent by the JS part for triggering the `whenReady` method.

Also, the default bus is named `default`. If you use that name for a custom bus, Caravel will automatically switch to the default one.

### Keep in mind event and bus names are case-sensitive.
